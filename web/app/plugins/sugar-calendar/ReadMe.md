Sugar Event Calendar is a commercial plugin available from [https://pippinsplugins.com](https://pippinsplugins.com/products/sugar-event-calendar/). The plugin is hosted here on a public GitHub repository in order to better facilitate community contributions from developers and users alike. If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, feel free to submit it here. I do ask, however, that if you are using the plugin on a live site that you please purchase a valid license from the [website](https://pippinsplugins.com/products/sugar-event-calendar/). I cannot provide support to anyone that does not hold a valid license key.
